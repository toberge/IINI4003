+ `friend` classes have access to the private members of the class they are a friend of.
  + ```cpp
    class A { public: friend class b; };
    ```
+ `protected` members are only accessible in subclasses, like they _should_ be
  + in contrast to Java, where `protected` simply means an extended package-level access
