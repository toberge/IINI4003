+ `unordered_set` is like Python's `set()` (or a boolean hash map)
+ `unordered_map` is your regular hash map
+ `set` and `map` apparently use red-black trees and are _ordered_
+ So the `unordered` versions have `O(1)` lookup time,
  while the ordered versions have `O(log n)` lookup time.
  However, the `unordered` maps and sets _will_ use more space
  and might have other performance problems that i am not aware of.
  Try `reserve()`ing the space needed beforehand, if it is a known amount.
