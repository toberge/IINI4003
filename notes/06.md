+ In case an object will go out of scope before a thread accesses it:
  + Use a shared_ptr.
  + `auto msg = make_shared<string>("some message");`
+ And of course, you do want to use mutexes:
  + `static mutex something_mutex;` is thread-safe
    + only do _this_ if it isn't needed elsewhere
  + `lock_guard<mutex> lock(something_mutex);` locks the mutex
    + unlocks when the `lock_guard` goes out of scope!
    + pretty handy and safer than relying on locking _and_ unlocking

+ But an asynchronous event loop... That's what Mister Eidheim likes.
  + `boost::asio::io_service`
